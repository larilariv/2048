## Project Description

2048 is a single player sliding puzzle game with a 4 x 4 grid and tiles with numerical values.

The game begins with 2 tiles on the board, both with a value of 2.
The player can move their tiles up, down, left, and right using the arrows on the screen.

With each move a new tile with a value of 2 is added to the board.

If two tiles of the same value collide, they will merge into ove tile that has the vaule of both tiles combined.

All tiles will move in the direction chosen by the player is there is enough space on the board.

The player wins if they can merge enough tiles to create a tile with the value of 2048.

If the player runs out of space on the board before they can create a tile of 2048, they lose.
